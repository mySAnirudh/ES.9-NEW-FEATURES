   Here, we will learn about the new features in ES9. Let us begin by understanding about 
the asynchronous generators.
Asynchronous Generators and Iteration
Asynchronous generators can be made asynchronous by using the async keyword. The 
syntax for defining an async generator is given below:
async function* generator_name()
{
//statements
}
Example
Following example shows an async generator which returns Promise on each call to 
the next() method of generator.
<script>
 async function* load(){
 yield await Promise.resolve(1);
 yield await Promise.resolve(2);
 yield await Promise.resolve(3);
 }
 
 let l = load();
 l.next().then(r=>console.log(r))
 l.next().then(r=>console.log(r))
 l.next().then(r=>console.log(r))
 l.next().then(r=>console.log(r))
</script>
